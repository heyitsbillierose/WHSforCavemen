### ✅ STEP 2: Download these HTML files from Claude:
- `neanderthal-tribe-enhanced.html` (main multiplayer game)
- `test-mode.html` (single-player testing version)

### ✅ STEP 3: Download these IMAGES:
Download from the chat and save with these EXACT names:
- `game-logo.png` (Cave-place Health and Safety logo)
- `caveman1.png` (first character)
- `caveman2.png` (second character)  
- `caveman3.png` (third character)
- `caveman4.png` (fourth character)
- `caveman5.png` (fifth character)
- `fire-animation.gif` (animated fire)
- `cave-wall.png` (cave background)

- `win-graphic.jpg` OR `win-graphic.png` (victory image - office workers)
- `lose-graphic.jpg` OR `lose-graphic.png` (defeat image - cavemen)

### ✅ STEP 4: Create an "audio" subfolder and put these files in it:

- `lose_fanfare.MP3` (defeat fanfare)
- `storyteller_shares.MP3` (wisdom sharing sound)
- `3_bonks_dead.MP3` (bonked out sound)

- Check file names in audio folder match exactly
- Try clicking somewhere on page first (browsers require user interaction)

**Multiplayer not syncing?**
- Everyone must be on the same network OR use hosted version
- If using file:// URLs locally, multiplayer won't work between computers
- Solution: Use GitHub Pages or Netlify
