⚠️ WIN/LOSE GRAPHICS NEEDED

The game is looking for these two images:
- win-graphic.jpg (the image with cavemen evolved to office workers)
- lose-graphic.jpg (the image with cavemen stuck in stone age)

Please add these images to the CavemanGame folder.

If you have them in a different format (.png), you can either:
1. Rename them to .jpg
2. OR update the HTML files to look for .png instead

The images should show:
- WIN: Cavemen transformed into modern office workers (evolution success)
- LOSE: Cavemen still in primitive state (evolution failed)
