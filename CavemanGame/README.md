## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Why Images/Sounds Don't Work Yet

The game files reference images and audio that need to be in **the same folder** as the HTML file. Since we're working in Claude, the files are currently scattered. Here's how to fix it:

---

## 🎯 EASIEST SETUP (3 Steps)

### STEP 1: Download Everything from Claude Chat
Download all these files by clicking on them in our conversation:

**HTML Files (2):**
- `neanderthal-tribe-enhanced.html`
- `test-mode.html`

**Image Files (11):**
- Logo and character images  
- Cave backgrounds
- Fire animation
- Win/lose graphics

**Audio Files (10):**
- All the .wav, .mp3, and .MP3 files

### STEP 2: Organize Files
```
Create this folder structure:

CavemanGame/
├── neanderthal-tribe-enhanced.html
├── test-mode.html
├── game-logo.png
├── caveman1.png
├── caveman2.png
├── caveman3.png  
├── caveman4.png
├── caveman5.png
├── fire-animation.gif
├── cave-wall.png
├── cave-floor.png
├── win-graphic.jpg
├── lose-graphic.jpg
└── audio/
    ├── ooh.wav
    ├── bonk.wav
    ├── warning.mp3
    ├── ambient-forest.mp3
    ├── ambient-fire.wav
    ├── ambient-wind.wav
    ├── lose_fanfare.mp3
    ├── win_fanfare.mp3
    ├── storyteller_shares.mp3
    └── 3_bonks_dead.mp3
```

### STEP 3: Test It!
1. Open `test-mode.html` in Chrome/Firefox
2. Click "Start Game" button
3. You should see images and hear sounds!

## 🌐 HOSTING FOR MULTIPLAYER

**Google Sites = ❌ Won't Work**
Google Sites doesn't support JavaScript or custom HTML files.

**These WILL Work:**

### ✅ GitHub Pages (Best Option - FREE)
1. Create account at github.com
2. New repository → Upload CavemanGame folder
3. Settings → Pages → Enable
4. Share URL with participants!

### ✅ Netlify (Easiest - FREE)  
1. Go to netlify.com
2. Drag and drop CavemanGame folder
3. Done! Instant URL

### ✅ Local/Offline
- Share zipped folder
- Everyone unzips and opens HTML file
- Works without internet!

---

## 🎮 HOW TO USE

### Solo Testing:
- Open `test-mode.html`
- Use test control buttons

### Real Multiplayer Game:
- Open `neanderthal-tribe-enhanced.html`  
- Create room → Share code
- Everyone joins with code
- Play together!

---

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

**No images showing?**
- Check all images are in same folder as HTML
- Check file names match EXACTLY (case-sensitive)

**No sounds playing?**
- Check `audio` folder exists  
- Check audio files are renamed correctly
- Click somewhere on page first (browser requirement)

**Can't sync multiplayer?**
- Must use hosted version (GitHub Pages/Netlify)
- OR everyone on same network
- Local file:// URLs won't sync between computers

---

## 📦 COMPLETE FILE CHECKLIST

### You need these 23 files total:

✅ 2 HTML files (game + test mode)
✅ 11 image files (characters, backgrounds, graphics)
✅ 10 audio files (sounds, music, fanfares)

**All files are available in this Claude conversation to download!**

---

## 💡 QUICK START FOR TESTING

Don't want to set everything up yet? Just want to see how it works?

1. Download just `test-mode.html`
2. Download the 11 image files
3. Put them in same folder
4. Open test-mode.html
5. Click around (sounds won't work yet but you'll see the game!)

Then add audio later when you're ready to deploy.

## 🎓 FOR YOUR TRAINING SESSION

**Recommended Flow:**
1. Host the game on GitHub Pages or Netlify
2. Share URL in Zoom chat
3. Create breakout rooms of 4-5 people
4. One person per room creates a game
5. Others join with room code
6. Play and learn about workplace safety!

**Time needed:** 15-20 minutes per game session
